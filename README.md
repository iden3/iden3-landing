First you will need to install the project dependencies running `npm i` from the root
of the project.

Then, you need to run `npm start` to launch a development server with hot-reloading.
It will be listening on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

The deployment process is triggered automatically on each push to the `main` branch
using a GitHub action.
